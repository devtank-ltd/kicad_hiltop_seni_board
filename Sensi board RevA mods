Sensi Boards mods


PCB
-Add jumper to JP1 bottom side so +3v3 is connected to +3v3_LOC
-Short cct D1
-Change R102 for 20Kohm
-Add R77 as 10Kohm
-Add C52 as 100nF
-For all 4-20mA ccts change both input resistors to 68R
- Fix voltage connection going to 4-20mA connector J6 (Voltage is on its own pin and all F+ pins are seperate). The tracks need cutting and repairing
-Replace R79 with inverter chip 2464477 farnell. Supply withe 3v3 and gnd. Connect input to boot line of CP210 chip and output of inverter to boot line of STM.
-For c60,c61,c66,c67 add 100k resistor 0402 across each of these.
-Fit SS16 schottky for all HS_OUT to GND. Connect negative side to HS_OUT.


############Don't do below IF SETTING UP SENSI/SENSI TRIP #############
-Change R120 for 100Kohm "NOT NEEDED"
-For themocouple circuit replace 10Kohm divider with 1Kohm (Needs further testing)
-On next version change molex connector footprint to match symbol

KiCAD
-On PCB layout C100 and C95 reference need swapping.
- Fix voltage connection going to 4-20mA connector J6 (Voltage is on its own pin, look at attached picture)
