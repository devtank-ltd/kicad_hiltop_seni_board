KiCAD master libraries:

I generally clone the following git repo's onto my computer under a common area e.g. username/documents/

I then setup kicad (within the tool settings) to point to these common libraries. Whenever i wish to check for new parts or libraries i can simply type "git pull" to retrieve the latest. 

Master libraries can be pulled down from Github at the following locations:


kicad-library/    #Schematic symbols and project templates
https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library.git


kicad-pcb/	#PCB footprints
https://github.com/kicad/kicad-footprints.git


kicad-packages3d/
